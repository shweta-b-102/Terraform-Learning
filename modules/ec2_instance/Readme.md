Challenges withOUT modules

1. Repetition of code
2. Chnages in AWS provider specific option will require change in Ec2 code blocks of all the teams.
3. Lack of Standardization.
4. Difficult to manage.
5. Difficult for developersto use. 


Solution: Using Modules

Terraform modules provide a way to organize and reuse infrastructure code, addressing the above challenges effectively:
Encapsulation: Modules group related resources together, making them easier to manage.
Reusability: Teams can reuse the same module across multiple projects, reducing code duplication.
Maintainability: Updates to provider-specific configurations are centralized, simplifying changes.
Standardization: Enforces best practices and consistency across infrastructure deployments.
Ease of Use: Developers can leverage well-documented modules without needing in-depth Terraform expertise.
